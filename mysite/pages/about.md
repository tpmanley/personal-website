Hi
==

I'm a self-proclaimed computer nerd living in St. Paul, MN with my wife,
Suzanne, and our dog, Bella. I was born and raised in Bemidji, MN, and
moved to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota. When I'm not
nerding out on my computer, phone or tablet, I like being active with sports
like soccer and Ultimate Frisbee, drinking craft beer and eating at teh great
restaurants we have in the Twin Cities area. (more about that below)

I got my start in software engineering with Bachelor degrees in both Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Engineering, and minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
During my first job after college (at Unisys Corporation), I attended grad school 
part time and obtained a Masters of Computer Engineering.


Professional
============

Currently, I am the Manager of Software Engineering at [Spectrum Design Solutions][spec]
in downtown Minneapolis, MN. The companies focus is wireless design services. The Software 
Engineering group handles the kernel, driver, bootloader, BSP and application development 
for systems with an OS like Embedded Linux or Windows CE. We have the opportunity to work 
with companies in many different industries and with many new and exciting technologies 
like Bluetooth low energy and 4G LTE. It's always challenging and a lot of fun!


Programming and Technology
==========================

Even when I'm not at my office, I love reading and talking about programming and technology. 
In my current role as a Software Engineering manager, I'm especially interested in things that 
help my team improve the quality of their software. This includes repeatable development and build 
environments, unit testing, continuous integration, and iterative development methodologies. I'm 
always on the lookout for best practices from the non-embedded software development world that may
be applicable to the development of embedded software. Here are some of the languages, tools, and 
technologies that I'm most interested in right now:

  - Languages: Python, C, C#
  - Python packages: Buildout, nose, mock, Fabric
  - Markdown, reST and Sphinx
  - Jenkins
  - Embedded Linux
  - TCP/IP
  - ZigBee, 802.15.4, Bluetooth, GSM/CDMA, 802.11, and other wireless and wired technologies


Personal
========

I met Suzanne while playing Ultimate Frisbee, a sport we continue to play when the 
weather cooperates. Soccer is my primary activity. The spring of 2013 marks the ten year 
anniversary of the co-ed recreational soccer team [Blazar FC][blazar] that I organize and 
play on. I'm also an occasional bike commuter and triathlete.

I have to replace those lost calories somehow and the Twin Cities are filled with great 
restaurants! Some of my favorites are right in my neighborhood like [The Groveland Tap][tap] and 
[The Nook][nook]. Near my office in downtown Minneapolis we've got [the 508][508], 
[Pizza Luce][luce] and [Trieste Cafe][trieste]

I'm a big fan of craft beer, which makes the Twin Cities a great place to live right now 
because new breweries are opening all the time. Some of my favorite breweries are:

  - [Summit][summit]
  - [Lift Bridge][lift]
  - [Founders][founders]
  - [Deschutes][deschutes]
  - [Odell][odell]
