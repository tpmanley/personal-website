title: First Post
date: 2013-01-13

This is the first post on my new blog. I decided to roll my own
blog engine by hand for the experience. I first considered using
[SQL Alchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and 
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) but decided against it
on this first go-around for the sake of simplicity. Instead I chose 
to write the blog posts in [Markdown](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) 
and use [Flask-FlatPages](http://packages.python.org/Flask-FlatPages/)
to connect the posts to the application. When I want to add a new
post I just create a new file with the post title, date and content,
push it up to the host, and that's it! Easy.
