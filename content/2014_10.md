Title: Switching to Pelican

The last two years have been spent ignoring this site so obviously
it is time to redo it. A coworker told me about [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.4.0/)
a while back and it seemed like it would fit my needs so I gave it a try. I turned
out to be really easy and I managed to convert the site to use Pelican
and publish to Heroku in about two hours.

First I installed Pelican into a virtualenv and ran the quickstart:

    :::bash
    pip install pelican
    pelican-quickstart

The quickstart just asks a few simple questions about the site. When
it was done I poked around in `pelicanconf.py` to see what knobs could
be fiddled with. I fixed up the timezone, removed SITES and filled in 
the SOCIAL links. This is what it looks like today:

    :::py
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- #
    from __future__ import unicode_literals

    AUTHOR = u'Tom Manley'
    SITENAME = u'Tom Manley'
    SITEURL = 'thomasmanley.org'

    PATH = 'content'

    TIMEZONE = 'America/Chicago'

    DEFAULT_LANG = u'en'

    DEFAULT_CATEGORY = 'Dev'

    ARTICLE_URL = 'posts/{date:%Y}/{date:%b}/{date:%d}/{slug}/'
    ARTICLE_SAVE_AS = 'posts/{date:%Y}/{date:%b}/{date:%d}/{slug}/index.html'

    # Feed generation is usually not desired when developing
    FEED_ALL_ATOM = None
    CATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = None
    TRANSLATION_FEED_ATOM = None

    # Social widget
    GITHUB_URL = 'https://github.com/tpmanley'
    SOCIAL = (('Twitter', 'https://twitter.com/tpmanley'),
              ('Github', 'https://github.com/tpmanley'),
              ('LinkedIn', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpmanley/'),)

    DEFAULT_PAGINATION = False

Since I setup Fabric during the quickstart process, testing the new site is easy:

    :::bash
    fab reserve

This builds and serves up the site at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The first thing that struck
me is how nice it looks. Just another reminder that I'm not a frontend kind of
guy.

Moving the content to Pelican was easy since it was already in Markdown. I just
moved the static pages into `content/pages/` and the single blog post (yeah, I
don't write much) into `content`.  

The last step was to publish the new site on Heroku. First I enabled the Heroku
buildpack:

    :::bash
    heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/getpelican/heroku-buildpack-pelican

Then I removed the `web:` line from the `Procfile` so now it is empty. Finally
I committed all the changes and pushed to Heroku like normal. And that was basically
it!

Only thing left to do is start writing more, and maybe replace the default theme.
