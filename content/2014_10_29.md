These are the podcasts I'm listening to lately.

# [Embedded](http://embedded.fm/)

This is a technical podcast hosted by Elecia White, author of 
[Making Embedded Systems](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449302149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449302149&linkCode=as2&tag=httpembefm-20). It's focused on embedded devices, 
hardware hackers, makers, and gadgets. There are many good episodes,
including one with my coworker Rob Faludi, author of 
[Building Wireless Sensor Networks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GTLFHI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004GTLFHI&linkCode=as2&tag=httpembefm-20&linkId=PQULDAK7MHSCIHP7).

# [Minnov8 Gang Podcast](http://minnov8.com/)

I just stumbled upon this one but it looks like it's been around quite a while. It has a good variety
of local and national tech related coverage. The format seems to be that the hosts each pick topics
from the news and then they discuss each topic for a few minutes. I've only listened to the last few
episodes so far but they have covered a lot of topics I'm interested in like IoT, Android and iOS.

# [Hak5](http://hak5.org/)

This one is a video podcast from the company behind the [Wi-Fi Pineapple](https://wifipineapple.com/).
I've only see a couple of episodes but it seems pretty good so far. It's already given me some ideas
of some things I want to do with the Pineapple I bought for use at work and some Android apps I
want to write.
