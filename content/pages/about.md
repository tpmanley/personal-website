This site is mainly for myself to document my learning and personal projects. A hoped for side-effect of writing more
is that my writing will improve from its current abysmal state. I'm the Manager of Software Engineering at
[Dig Wireless Design Services](http://www.digi.com/wds) and the blog topics will often
relate to the technology we use there. My team handles the Embedded Linux and Android kernel, driver, bootloader,
BSP and application development for custom or existing hardware platforms. We specialize in quick turn product development
with a focus on wireless technologies like cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth classic and low-energy, ZigBee and GPS.
I'm passionate about software quality which I believe can be obtained by unit testing, continuous integration, iterative
development, solid requirements, and a bunch of other stuff. I also believe you should never stop learning or improving
